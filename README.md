I came up with this app idea almost 2 years ago when I was looking for a boarding house. In that 
period, I felt that if there was an app with these features, it would have made things much easier. So 
I found some apps, but they were confusing and not user friendly. That experience inspired me to 
create this University Boarding Finder App (Uni Nest) 
In this UI design, I used yellow color, which is very clear, user-friendly, warm and welcoming. Users 
can find their boarding house according to their campus, making the process faster and more 
relevant.

Each boarding listing includes:

• Distance to the campus   
• Exact location  
• Images of the boarding place   
• Available facilities   
• Monthly rental price   
• Landlord's contact details and more important information 

The app allows users to book a boarding house by making an online advance payment. For 
landlords, the app provides the ability to add their accommodation listings, along with contact 
information, images, facility details and location. 
Thia app aims to solve a real-world problem faced by many university students when searching for 
convenient and reliable boarding places.
